These scripts are run on a scheduler on UNIX/Linux systems 
called CRON

you can make tasks on CRON, which are called "cronjobs"

if you would like to add, modify or inspect cronjobs, use

"crontab -e"

If a file containing instructions, and no lines of actual
code, it is a new cronfile, and must have tasks added

to add a cron task, use this template, or follow the 
instructions in the page opened

"m* h* dom* mon* dow* "command here" "

To define the time you can provide concrete values for
minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').

For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
at 5 a.m every week with:

"0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/"

for the OpenVision system, two jobs should be present 

"15 * * * * echo "Dropped Cache" | /home/pi/cronscripts/drop_cache

and

"15 * * * * echo "Refreshed Tab" | /home/pi/cronscripts/refresh
