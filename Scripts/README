			      OpenPiVision

This USB contains any essential running files and scripts.
Scripts are sorted by where/what they are executed by.

Open the instruction or readme file in each folder for 
more information on each process, and how to implement
them onto a fresh system.

If you are implementing the OpenVision system on a fresh 
install of a raspberry pi rather than using the premade ISO,
copy the root folder of this USB, named "OpenPiVision", and
copy it to "/home/pi/". The cronjobs are made to call scripts
in this directory, so please copy them to this directory
specifically unless you intend to change them later in the 
crontab

Autostart : This script runs immediatlety upon start up of
	    the Pi. The script is responsible for opening a 
	    chromium tab upon startup, in kisok mode.
	    Kisok mode makes the browser locked, so unable 
	    to be used and tampered with. If you need to exit,
	    press "Alt + F4"

Cronscripts : These scripts are run on a periodic period using
	      a tool called "cronjobs". 

	Drop Cache : Clears the browser cache on a periodic
		     basis in order to get the updated 
 		     webpage information. This occurs every
		     -15 minutes-

	Auto Refresh : Refreshes the chromium browser tab 
		       directly after the browser cache is 
		       refreshed to display updated
		       browser cache data.
