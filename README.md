# RiseVisionPi
Open source edition of RiseVision ecosystem. Chrome Boxes are replaced with Raspberry Pi 4s, with ethernet, USB A ports, and a MicroSD card slot. Raspberry Pis connect to local server, and display content to the TVs, acting as an intermediate, or a buffer to output to the TVs (made by amateurs)!
